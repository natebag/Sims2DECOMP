# Walls — Functions that did not match cleanly

This is the honest backlog. Each entry below is a function a matcher tried to
write clean C++ for but couldn't get to byte-identical output without reaching
for the banned tools (ASMPROC mutators, NON_MATCHING, register-pin, inline asm).

**Logging a wall is legitimate progress.** It documents what the frontier looks
like, what was tried, and what the next attempt should consider. Over months,
walls either get cracked by a smarter pass / a different compiler flag baseline /
a new contributor — or they stay as honest documentation of the project's
current ceiling.

## How to log

Add a new section at the bottom of this file with this shape:

```
## 0xADDRESS NameOfFunction (sizeB)

**Tried:** what you attempted (source shape, flag overrides, type variations).

**Asm shape that didn't reduce:** the specific DOL instruction pattern that no
C++ form you wrote could naturally emit. Paste 3-6 lines of the divergent
section if useful.

**Notes / hypotheses:** ideas for the next pass — possible compiler quirks,
struct-layout suspicions, candidate flag tweaks, etc.

**Logged by:** <matcher name>, YYYY-MM-DD.
```

## How to retry

If you (or a later pass) think you can crack a wall:

1. Read the entry.
2. Attempt a clean match using the new idea.
3. On clean MATCH → commit normally, then **delete the wall entry** here.
4. On MISMATCH → either iterate further or append a new "Retried" note to the
   existing entry (don't replace; preserve the trail).
